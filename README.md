# Social Simulation Replications

This repository contains replications of important pieces in social simulation research, to provdie modern social simulators a tool to interact with these touchstone pieces.

## Goals

This project has three principal Goals
1. Repicate touchstone social simulation papers, which did not publish their code.
2. Replicate using R, a more accessible tool for many social scientsts of today.
3. Provide clear, instructive, easy to understand code that will be useful for a social scientist to analyse and learn more about R.
4. Provide a straight, unedited replication, as close to the original paper as possible.

## Choice of programming languages

These replications will primarily be written with R. This is to strike a balance between accessibility (as computationally-interested social scientists tend to focus on R) and 
power (any language less program-y would be insufficient to the task). I retain the right to provide code in other languages (ex. Python, Julia) where it provides some advantage to do so.
