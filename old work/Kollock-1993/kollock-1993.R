# Abstract:
# Explores tit-for-tat type cooperation and the benefits of alternative strategies in which actors use different accounting systems to 
#   track ongoing exchanges by means of computer simulations that permit degrees of cooperation and that introduce noise into the environment. 
#   Conditions were charted under which cooperation may emerge when actors can show degrees of cooperation and when actors' moves are misperceived. 
#   Results demonstrate the significant effects of noise and the usefulness of a Prisoner's Dilemma game allowing degrees of cooperation. 
#   Findings provide evidence that strategies employing a more relaxed accounting system than tit-for-tat have many advantages. 
#   For example, the ability to dampen cycles of recrimination outweighs the increased vulnerability to exploitation in many environments.
