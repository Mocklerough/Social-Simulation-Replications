# Bruch and Mare only desccribe the initial placement of agents within the city as that "
# they are arranged with an index of dissimilarity of zero across a fixed grid of tracts."
# They do not describe how this is done, however they state they donot take Schelling's 
# strategy of random placements.

# *D = 'index of dissimilarity', where 0 represents a perfectly homogenous mixing

# This is problematic because You cannot gurantee that D = 0 for most ratios of B/W populations with finite numbers of agents,
# Further, their arguments that Shelling's random placement (RP) "the initial values of the segregation
# scores are affected by the proportion minority in the cityâ€™s population" is untrue, as D accounts for proportion.

# I take it to assume that Bruch and Mare used Structured Alternating Placement (SAP) (EX:B-W-B-W-B-W)
# This script compares the actual D score of SAP against RP
