# Abstract: 
#   This article examines the relationships between the residential
#   choices of individuals and aggregate segregation patterns. Analyses
#   based on computational models show that high levels of segregation
#   occur only when individualsâ€™ preferences follow a threshold function.
#   If individuals make finer-grained distinctions among neighborhoods
#   that vary in racial composition, preferences alone do not
#   lead to segregation. Vignette data indicate that individuals respond
#   in a continuous way to variations in the racial makeup of neighborhoods
#   rather than to a threshold. Race preferences alone may be
#   insufficient to account for the high levels of segregation observed in
#   American cities.

# A Closer Look at the Agent-Based Model ----------------------------------

# The model... uses a 500 x 500 cell grid populated by interacting agents.
# When the model is initialized, the agents are evenly distributed across the grid 
# MODELING CHOICE: Bruch & Mare do not describe this process, besides it being non-random and has an index of dissimilarity of 0
#       but do not specify how. I populate cells alternating between B and W, then remove 15% of each at random
